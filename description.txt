Read and write binary data to streams.  This is useful when
interfacing to external systems, like C, or in reading binary file
formats, such as data files or music.  Using a declarative syntax you
can define the structure of the binary file, and then load it with all
the definitions populated.  There is also a stream based interface for
reading/writing individual elements.
